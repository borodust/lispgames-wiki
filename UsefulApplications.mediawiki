This page collects information on various free applications useful to
Lisp game developers. Many non-Lisp applications provide Lisp
extensibility or bindings.

=Lisp-extensible applications=

* [http://www.gimp.org The GIMP] image editor has Lisp-fu.
* The [https://ccrma.stanford.edu/software/snd/ SND audio editor] is a sort of "audio Emacs" using Scheme. Like Emacs, SND has a high learning curve, is highly extensible, and pretty high quality.
* [http://eca.cx/ecasound/ Ecasound] is easy to extend with Emacs Lisp. I would like to convert these to Common Lisp at some point.
* [http://milkytracker.org/ Milkytracker], aside from being a lot of fun, produces XM music files whose musical cues can be triggered from Common Lisp via [[Lispbuilder-SDL]].
* [http://www.csounds.com/ CSound] has both Emacs Lisp and Common Lisp interoperability, with a range of interactive Emacs tools as well.

=Useful, but not currently Lisp-extensible=

Please correct any entries I'm wrong about.

* [http://audacity.sourceforge.net Audacity] for sound editing.
* [http://puredata.info/ Pure Data] for audio synthesis and processing. 
* [http://dssi.sourceforge.net/hexter.html Hexter] is a free Yamaha DX-7 software emulator.
