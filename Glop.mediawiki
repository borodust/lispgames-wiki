The goal is to provide simple [[Opengl|OpenGL]] window and context manipulation code as well as system input handling (i.e. mouse & keyboard).

Direct [[CFFI]] bindings to system functions are used so no third party C lib is required except system libraries.

glop currently supports [[Windows]] and [[X11]] using [[clisp]], [[sbcl]] or [[ccl]].
