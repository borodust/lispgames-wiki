'''Learning Common Lisp''' is a permanent condition, affecting even the most experienced hackers. But for those who are just beginning, the following resources will be helpful.

== Resources ==

* Start with the Common Lisp Wiki (or CLiki) [http://www.cliki.net/Education Education page].
* The [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Lisp Wikipedia page on Common Lisp] has an overview, code examples, and links. Browsing through the examples there will familiarize you with the syntax, which will help a lot in getting started.
* Here is an interesting [http://abhishek.geek.nz/docs/features-of-common-lisp/ Common Lisp feature list].
* There are also many [http://www.lispmachine.net/ free lisp books] and other educational resources.
* If you have general common lisp questions, you can ask comp.lang.lisp on usenet, lispforum.com, or #lisp on irc.freenode.org.
