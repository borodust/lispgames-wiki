[Racket gaming](https://github.com/samvv/racket-gaming) is a library for rapid game development, featuring a fully integrated physics engine built on top of the [Chipmunk2D physics engine](https://chipmunk-physics.org).

## History

### Software Language Lab

To help students finish off their first programming project, the professors and assistants at the [VUB](https://vub.ac.be)'s Software Languages Lab receive a small library which provides basic functionality for drawing and reading user input. This marked the beginning of the Racket gaming library, as an attempt to fill some of the gaps that remained in this library.

### Appearance on Hacker News

To the author's own surprise, the library was briefly featured on [Hacker News](http://news.ycombinator.com) which gave an instant rise to the amount of GitHub stars it received daily.

### Left To Decay

Because the primary author has been busy with other projects, for several years the development stagnated.

### A New Start

Thanks to new efforts that marked the partial completion of a side-project called [AutoFFI](https://github.com/AutoFFI/AutoFFI), the author was finally able to complete the highly-needed embeddable physics engine [Chipmunk2D](https://chipmunk-physics.org). This, in turn, marked the beginning of the new library.
