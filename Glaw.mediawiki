Glaw is not really a game engine but a collection of utilities to write games.

Its core only depend on [http://github.com/3b/cl-opengl cl-opengl] (without glu or glut) for graphics and [http://github.com/sykopomp/cl-openal cl-openal] (without alut) for sound.
Source code with examples is available [http://github.com/patzy/glaw here].

Glaw provides facilities for:
* resources/assets management
* input
* scheduling
* 2D rendering (shapes, tilemap, sprites)
* animation (keyframed)
* particle systems
* pathfinding (A*, navigation mesh)
* game state management (''screens'')
* sound (native wave/riff support)
* text (bitmap fonts from images or ''fonttool'' files)
* GUI (windows, button, ...)
* in-game console/REPL

Extensions are available for:
* image loading using [[imago]]
* lb-sdl integration

A few tools are included:
* fonttool: create bitmap font files using freetype
* shapedit: 2D shape editor (output in s-exp based file format with native support in glaw)

Small games written using glaw include:
* [http://github.com/patzy/outbreak outbreak]: a simple breakout clone
* [http://github.com/patzy/kayou kayou]: asteroid clone
* [http://github.com/patzy/push push]: on-button game (entry for ILGE2010)
