Glaw is not really a game engine but a collection of utilities to write games.

Its core only depend on [http://github.com/3b/cl-opengl cl-opengl] (without glu or glut) for graphics and [http://github.com/sykopomp/cl-openal cl-openal] (without alut) for sound.
Source code with examples is available [http://github.com/patzy/glaw here].

Small games written using glaw include:
* [http://github.com/patzy/outbreak outbreak]: a simple breakout clone
* [http://github.com/patzy/kayou kayou]: asteroid clone
* [http://github.com/patzy/push push]: on-button game (entry for ILGE2010)
