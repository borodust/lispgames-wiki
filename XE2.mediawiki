XE2 is a Common Lisp 2D game engine developed by [[User:dto1138]]. It
uses its own custom object system called CLON, based on prototypes
instead of classes.

CLON and XE2 are both being upgraded and revised to make improvements
in ease of use and developer documentation. I will update the links
below with updated info as it becomes available. 

== Features ==

* 2D grid-based worlds, with additional sprite support
* Basic procedural content tools
* Map editor (working, but in progress: see [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5KmZxQxiJ0 this video] for a demo.)
* Both turnbased and real-time play supported
* GUI widgets: formatted text output, simple text editing, 
* Ray-casting based lighting effects and line-of-sight
* A-star pathfinding (still being ported)
