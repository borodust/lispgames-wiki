'''Non Lisp Specific Resources'''

Many challenges in game development are relevant to all languages. The links below are not necessarily about Lisp but may be very useful.
These links are those that are suitably lisp agnostic or are written in another language entirely.

=== Functional Game Programming ===
* [http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Yampa Functional Reactive Programming with Yampa (Haskell)]
* [http://www.altdevblogaday.com/2012/04/26/functional-programming-in-c/ John Carmack on functional programming in c++]
* [http://www.idt.mdh.se/utbildning/exjobb/files/TR0811.pdf HaGPipe A DSL for programming the entire graphical pipeline (Haskell) (pdf)]
* [http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~pls/thesis/munc-thesis.pdf Functional Programming and 3D Games (pdf) (haskell)]

=== Graphics ===
* [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenGL_Programming#Modern_OpenGL Modern OpenGL (gl) (wiki or pdf)] This creative commons wikibook is a good place to get started with opengl as it uses v2.1 which is common and also the programmable pipeline, which is essential to modern game graphics.

=== Procedural Media Generation  ===
* [http://www.ii.uib.no/~knute/lsystems/lsystems.final.ps.gz L-Systems, Twinning Plants, Lisp (postscript) (cmucl)] LSystems were introduced as a mathematical model for cellular plant growth and are commonly used in the games industry for generating all manner of plants from tiny flowers to palm trees.

=== Pages of Links ===
Some people have collected a fantastic swathe of links themselves. Rather than reproduce them all here go have a gander at their sites.

=== Code ===
Some code is so well written it can be read for inspiration for your own Lisp projects, if you want to see working implementations of game elements, see the following
* [http://www.ogre3d.org/ Ogre3D] Ogre is written in c++ and is incredibly clean and readable as well as being open source.

=== Help! ===
Although there isn't much lisp specific info in the sites below, many issues crop up in all languages so these are worth a gander.

== Books ==
Unfortunately, unless you are some kind of digital bloodhound, you may struggle to piece together all the disparate information regarding game development online. Sometimes you just can't beat a good book.
