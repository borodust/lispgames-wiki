# List of (unknown) Lisp dialects and other s-expression based langauges
[dale](https://github.com/tomhrr/dale):
c with s-expressions:
very simple c function calls, lisp-like macros, some c++ features (overloading and type information even for macros), good documentation

[ketos](https://github.com/murarth/ketos):
A lisp language, which can be called from Rust. Rust provides some nice libs for game development (safe abstractions for opengl and vulkan), and even lisp-like macros generated at compile time (which may enable even more lisp/s-expressions in rust programs).

[None](https://bitbucket.org/duangle/nonelang):
A language made for game programming based on Lua-Jit, has C-interop, support for naked expression (no brackets, but correct indentation needed)
