'''Welcome to the Lisp Games Wiki!'''

This wiki is the Official Community Portal (TM) of the Lisp Games community, devoted to creating games and other interactive multimedia constructions with the programmable programming language, [[Lisp]], in its various dialects: [[CommonLisp]], [[Scheme]], [[Clojure]], [[Parenscript]], [[Clojurescript]], [[EmacsLisp]], and others. These user-editable pages are for YOU: people sharing information, links, and discussions related to Lisp Games Development.

We've been updating the wiki to make it a more comprehensive resource for the Lispgames community. If you'd like to help out, please create an account and start adding ideas, questions, or links to your own or others' projects. Or join #lispgames on freenode to chat with someone. (See [http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Formatting MediaWiki's formatting help page] for hints on editing. If you would prefer to use Emacs to edit the site, see [http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/MediaWikiMode the EmacsWiki page on MediaWikiMode.])

== News for 2012-03-08 ==

* A call for [[2012 Spring Lisp Game Jam]] ideas!
* [[Blocky]] is now in preliminary beta release.

== New about these parts? == 
Sorry, these two pages havent been written yet, but please check back soon.

[[What is Lisp?]]

[[Why use Lisp for games?]]

== Resources, by dialect ==

Lisp is a family of languages and each can have different libraries available. Check out what is particular to each dialect below.

[[CommonLisp]], [[Scheme]], [[Clojure]], [[Clojurescript]], [[EmacsLisp]], [[Parenscript]]

== Non Lisp Specific Resources == 

Many challenges in game development are relevant to all languages. The links below are not necessarily about Lisp but may be very useful.

[[Non Lisp Specific Resources]]

== Free Art & Audio Assets ==
Though it's very unlikely you'd be able to find enough free assets to make your game from while keeping a consistent style, free art assets can be very handy as placeholders in your game to help give others (and yourself!) a glimpse of where the game is heading. It can be very hard to inspire people to the noble effort of a orphan cube, battling for justice and vengeance against the hoards of malevolent spheres!

=== Wiki Todo List ===

Here are some pages you could write or add to: 

* Page generally describing [[Lisp]], hopefully written in a manner [[AccessibleToNewcomers]].
* Collect more dialect-specific resources: [[CommonLisp]], [[Scheme]], [[Clojure]], [[EmacsLisp]], [[GOAL]], [[Parenscript]], [[Clojurescript]] 
* A permanent [[LispGamesArchive]] that people could donate things to, sort of like the Interactive Fiction Archive.
* [[ObstaclesToLispNewcomers]], [[CoolThingsWeShouldKnowAbout]]

== Lisp Games In The Wild ==
Some games written using lisp-family languages.

* [http://dto.github.com/notebook/xong.html XONG]
* [http://sourceware.org/xconq/ Xconq] is a free strategy game that uses Lisp to define its war scenarios.
* [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abuse_%28video_game%29 Abuse] was a great action game that used Lisp for scripting its game logic.
* Jak and Daxter (Naughty Dog) was apparently partly written in a custom Lisp dialect called [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Oriented_Assembly_Lisp GOAL]. See also this [http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?LispInJakAndDaxter C2 wiki page on LispInJakAndDaxter]
* [[Common Worm]]
* [[Farmageddon]]
