== Who? ==

I'm Andreas W.

On freenode (IRC), my nickname is '''add^_'''.

== Lisp? ==

I have been using lisp languages (Common Lisp, Scheme and Racket mostly) since around 2008.

I use SBCL; C; GNU Guile for Scheme; Racket; and Emacs 24.  All on (K)Ubuntu GNU/Linux (This is subject to change every so often).

== Games? ==

I've never *really* finished a game-project of mine, at most I've made a platforming... thing that you could move around on.
I'm probably known to drop projects because of my limited attention-span and patience, but I always keep the ideas around just in case.

I've been playing Minecraft since Alpha, nowadays modded.
I've also watched a ton of let's plays of different games, like Final Fantasy I-IX and The Legend of Zelda.

== Why? ==

Why lisp for making games?
Because it's a rapid development programming language, with nothing less than powerful macros which have the ability to extend the language.
It have an awesome community, of course, not as huge as Python, C or even Java, but it's friendly (doesn't apply to trolls, as per usual) and very helpful as long as your questions aren't obviously easy to answer with the help from a search engine.
And most of all, it's fun and a good way to learn new things.

== Credits? ==
Of course, if you haven't already noticed, I took the "template" for this page from [[User:Arbscht|Arbscht]], thank you Arbscht!
