The [http://wiki.github.com/BradWBeer/Qix/ Qix Universal Media Editor] is an experimental, three-dimensional development and productivity tool. Simply, it is Emacs abstracted to to edit text, 2D & 3D graphics, and sound. As such it is meant to be a ''media'' editor. It uses Pango and Cairo for text rendering. OpenGL for 3D, and SDL for the rest. I'm currently working on a REPL inside the 3D environment. 

Features:

* A WYSIWYG environment for text, rich text, pictures, and 3D.
* A simple interface for displaying and updating data.
* A stand alone development environment.
* A single application for displaying and editing various forms of data.

There are some pictures of my work so far on my user page [[User:WarWeasle]] any my blog:  [http://lisp-qix.blogspot.com/ Lisp-Qix.]
