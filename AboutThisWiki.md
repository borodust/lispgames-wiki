## Github

This wiki is hosted on Github, and is editable by any registered user. The [lispgames Github organization](https://github.com/lispgames) account is controlled by these people: https://github.com/orgs/lispgames/people (who may also be reached on IRC).

## Domain

Control of the [lispgames.org](https://www.gandi.net/whois/details?search=lispgames.org) domain belongs to the lispgames commons. It is currently maintained by [[arbscht|User:Arbscht]] with a [Gandi](http://gandi.net) account.

The domain is manually renewed on a 1-year basis every November (just in case!). Registration of the domain can be transferred to any other volunteer after discussion among the #lispgames community on IRC. For convenience, currently funding is not shared and there is no formal management process. Try the #lispgames IRC channel or contact the maintainer for domain-related technical support.

## Twitter

There is Twitter account called [@lispgames](https://twitter.com/lispgames) which is currently maintained by [borodust](https://github.com/borodust). This also belongs to the lispgames commons and is available for any volunteer(s) to take over.

## History

A lispgames wiki grew out of the #lispgames IRC channel circa 2010, and was on a MediaWiki instance hosted by sykopomp. Around 2015, this Github copy of the same content was prepared as a better-maintained and more accessible instance. In January 2016, this became the nominal lispgames.org website and wiki.
