This page is for ideas and links related to motion control, image processing, CL-V4L2, Playstation Move, Xbox Kinect, OpenCV, computer vision, motion detection, dance pads, MIDI, and more. The point is to begin integrating movement controls of various kinds into Common Lisp game libraries.


== Motion Detection, Image/Video Processing and Computer Vision ==
* [http://www.ai.sri.com/~connolly/ Christopher I. Connolly's SRI page] has pretty advanced stuff including video tracking, event analysis and motion detection, mostly written in combination of Common Lisp and C++.
** [http://www.ai.sri.com/~connolly/sentient/index.html Sentient Environments] Video tracking and event analysis.
** [http://www.ai.sri.com/~connolly/freedius/basics.html FREEDIUS] FREEDIUS includes tools for developing image understanding algorithms, extracting geometric features from imagery, geolocation of imagery and features, construction of sensor models, and GUI development. [http://www.ai.sri.com/~connolly/freedius/basics.html]
* [http://jandmworks.com/ J. K. Cunningham's page] has information on motion detection and a Common Lisp motion detection project using [http://www.ljosa.com/~ljosa/software/cl-png/ cl-png].

* There seems to be an unmaintened [https://github.com/lispcar/cl-opencv attempt] to create a basic CL wrapper around OpenCV called cl-opencv.
