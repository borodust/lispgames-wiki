Until It Dies is a rapid-prototyping game engine for [[Common Lisp]], currently under development.
It aims to be a solid platform for quickly putting together 2d and 3d games.

== Features ==
* [[OpenGL]]-based rendering.
* Can load a wide variety of image types as textures, using [[cl-devil]].
* Positional audio using [[cl-openal]].
* Modular architecture using [[CLOS]].
* Support for multiple windows.

== Planned Features ==
* A/V decoding using [[ffmpeg]].
* Audio streaming (currently, UID can only load full sound clips to memory).
* Choice between [[cl-devil]] and [[imago]] for image loading.
* Physics using [[SquirL]].
* Particle engine.
* GUI-building module.
