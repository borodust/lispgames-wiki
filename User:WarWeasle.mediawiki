== Overview ==

WarWeasle is currently working on a [[Qix]], a universal media editor in Lisp using OpenGL, SDL, Pango, Cairo, and FreeImage. I have a blog at [http://lisp-qix.blogspot.com/ Lisp-Qix] where I post my updates and such. I have a degree in electronics engineering, am a professional programmer, and am currently working as an internal applications web developer and general computer/electronics problem-solver.  I enjoy Lisp, 3D graphics, video games, and spending time with my family. 

I work with C, C++, HTML, Javascript, ASP, PHP, Visual Basic, SQL, Assembly Language, Scheme, and of course, Lisp. My favorite tools are Emacs, Blender, Inkscape, and Gimp.

== Do you know you misspelled Weasel? ==

Yes. 

== Was this on purpose? ==

Also, yes.

== Quote ==

== Pictures of My Work ==
