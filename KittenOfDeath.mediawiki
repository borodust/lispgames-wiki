Dumped executables from SBCL on Win32 open a useless terminal window with the message "Your kitten of death awaits." User nyef from #lisp sent me this, but I haven't tried it yet:

 (with-open-file (exe #p"path/to/game.exe" :direction :io :element-type '(unsigned-byte 8))
   (file-position exe #x3c)
   (let* ((b0 (read-byte exe))
	  (b1 (read-byte exe))
	  (b2 (read-byte exe))
	  (b3 (read-byte exe))
	  (pe-header (dpb (dpb b3 (byte 8 8) b2)
			  (byte 16 16)
			  (dpb b1 (byte 8 8) b0))))
     (file-position exe (+ pe-header #x5c))
     (write-byte 3 exe)))
