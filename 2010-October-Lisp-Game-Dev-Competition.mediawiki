== When ==

The October Lisp Game Dev Competition begins on '''Sunday''' at '''2010-10-24 00:01 UTC''' and runs for '''seven days'''.

== How to enter ==

* Build a game using a lisp language while the competition is on.
* Register on this wiki and add your details below by Sunday, October 31.

== Rules ==

* Use a lisp variant as the primary language to build your game.  That can include Common Lisp, Scheme, Clojure, Emacs Lisp, or even your own lisp-like invention.  The rest of the technology is up to you.
* Work on your project substantially during the competition.  You may continue developing a project you started before the competition, but we want to see some new work being done on it.

== Entries ==

List your name and project (with links) if you are entering the competition.  You can enter at any time until Sunday, October 31, but we like to see works in progress.

* ''Game'', by ''Author''. ''Description''.
