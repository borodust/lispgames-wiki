The '''2010 October Lisp Game Dev Competition''' is a fun, seven-day, online challenge for lisp hackers to produce computer games using a lisp variant.

== When and where ==

* Currently '''completed'''. The event began on Sunday, October 24 at 2010-10-24 00:01 UTC and ran until Sunday, October 31 (ish).
* The competition is entirely run online.  Chat about it on IRC at #lispgames on chat.freenode.net and follow [http://twitter.com/lispgames lispgames on Twitter].

== Post-mortems ==

''Link to various write-ups and reports here'''

== How to enter ==

* Build a game using a lisp language while the competition is on, and publish it somewhere.
* Register on this wiki and add your details below by Sunday, October 31.

== Rules ==

* Use a lisp variant as the primary language to build your game.  That can include Common Lisp, Scheme, Clojure, Emacs Lisp, or even your own lisp-like invention.  The rest of the technology is up to you.
* Work on your project substantially during the competition.  You may continue developing a project you started before the competition, but we want to see some new work being done on it.

== Entries ==

List your name and project (with links) if you are entering the competition.  You can enter at any time until Sunday, October 31, but we like to see works in progress.
