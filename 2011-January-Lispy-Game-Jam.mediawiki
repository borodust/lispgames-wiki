The '''2011 January Lispy Game Jam''' is a fun, seven-day, online challenge for lisp hackers to produce computer games using a lisp variant.

== When and where ==

* The event is penciled in to start on the 10th January (exact time TBC), and will run for 7 days.
* The competition is entirely run online.  Chat about it on IRC at #lispgames on chat.freenode.net and follow [http://twitter.com/lispgames lispgames on Twitter].

== How to enter ==

* Build a game using a lisp language while the competition is on, and publish it somewhere.
* Register on this wiki and add your details below by the day before the competition, currently Sunday, January 9th.

== Rules ==

* Use a lisp variant as the primary language to build your game within the chosen theme.  That can include Common Lisp, Scheme, Clojure, Emacs Lisp, or even your own lisp-like invention.  The rest of the technology is up to you.

== Themes ==

The theme will probably involve three elements, a combination of one thematic, one gameplay & one technical, as outlined [http://globalgamejam.org/wiki/content-theme-competition-restraints-tracks here].

Please add your theme element suggestions below (N.B. A random combination will be selected for the competition)

; Thematic
: Love
; Gameplay
: Minimal interaction
; Technical
: Never the same play twice
