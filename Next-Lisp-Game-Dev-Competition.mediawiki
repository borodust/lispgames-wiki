The [[2010 October Lisp Game Dev Competition]] is on.

There has been no LGDC recently. The [[ILGE2010|2010 International Lisp Games Expo]] was the most recently held compo. The next LGDC event is being planned here.

== To decide ==

'''Introduce a theme for all submissions'''
* What is the theme going to be?
** Ludum Dare votes on themes. Some of their failed candidates seem promising (e.g. "Unwanted Powers") so we could recycle them. Voting itself may be overkill for us. [[User:Arbscht|Arbscht]] 10:56, 1 October 2010 (EDT)
** dto likes "UFO"
** LD17 Suggestions: http://old.ludumdare.com/wiki/ld17:themes
*** batteries not included (or "some assembly required")
*** breaking laws (of physics)
*** conservation of energy
*** demoscene
*** management

'''How long should it run for?'''
* probably one week
* IGLE2010 was 7 weeks
* 48 hours is too short, 4 weeks is too long. [[User:Arbscht|Arbscht]] 10:56, 1 October 2010 (EDT)

''' When should it be held?'''
* dto suggested 10/10 in #lispgames
** too soon, I think.  [[User:Sharps|Sharps]] 10:40, 1 October 2010 (EDT)

''' How will it be organised?'''
* Should do registration page, keep a central list of people/games/writeups, then email reminders to people.  [[User:Sharps|Sharps]] 10:43, 1 October 2010 (EDT)
