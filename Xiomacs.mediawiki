XIOMACS is an attempt by [[User:dto1138]] at a "format
agnostic" media creation and processing suite suitable for making
games and other experiences. 

Whereas [[Qix]] aims at a universal media editing tool, XIOMACS takes
the opposite approach and uses Lisp to tie together existing
[[UsefulApplications]] such as the GIMP, GNU Emacs, ImageMagick, and
so on. 

XIOMACS uses [[OrgMode]] to manage a hierarchical tree of entries,
each with embedded asset chunks, workflow information, and metadata in
the form of Org entry properties. These asset libraries can be
compiled to LispPak format for use by external applications.

See [http://dto.github.com/notebook/xiomacs.html the XIOMACS page] for
a description of the project.
