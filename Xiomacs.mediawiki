XIOMACS is an attempt by [User:dto1138 David O'Toole] at a "format
agnostic" media creation and processing suite suitable for making
games and other experiences. 

Whereas [[Qix]] aims at a universal media editing tool, XIOMACS takes
the opposite approach and uses Lisp to tie together existing
[[UsefulApplications]] such as the GIMP, GNU Emacs, ImageMagick, and
so on. 

See [http://dto.github.com/notebook/xiomacs.html the XIOMACS page] for
a description of the project.
